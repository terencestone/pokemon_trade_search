# The Pokemon Network 

A passion project that uses Rails, React and the Poke API. As of now, it is simply a pokedex. Type the name of any pokemon and (almost) instantly see its picture and description. Eventually, I'd like to make it a social network for pokemon fans that facilitates trades and battles as well as a Wiki for all things pokemon.
